## Overview
Project can be split into two parts: Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Code and examples is given for both of these. A report is also given for the Deep Learning section.

## Deep Learning
Had to create a generative model for images of white, winged horses using only the Cifar10 and STL100 datasets independently. An example of a generated image is given below. For details of the theory used please see 'pegasus-paper.pdf'.

## Reinforcement Learning
Had to create a reinforcement learning agent that could play the atari game 'Gravitar'. An example run can be seen below.
